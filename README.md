# Advent of Code 2022

Taking Python 3.11 for a spin.

## Usage

- Create a virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```
- Activate the virtual environment:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- Install requirements:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Execute a file—e.g.:

```shell
python day1.py
```

- Time the execution—e.g.:

```shell
time python day1.py
```

## Testing

Only simplistic example cases have been added (so far…).

- Assuming `pytest` is installed:

```shell
pytest
```
